## Abstract
<p align="justify">
TyreTech Hub provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring and maintaining dumper tyres through real-time data tracking. By leveraging sensors, such as a temperature sensor and air pressure sensor, the system continuously collects tyre health data, including temperature and pressure, providing operators with crucial insights for maintenance. The data is displayed on a web interface and stored in Firebase for real-time updates and historical tracking. The integration of the ESP8266 module enables wireless communication between the sensors and the cloud, making this system efficient and accessible from anywhere.
